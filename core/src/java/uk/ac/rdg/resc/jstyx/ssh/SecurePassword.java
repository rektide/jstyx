     * Reads chars from in until an end-of-line sequence (EOL) or end-of-file (EOF) is encountered,
     * and then returns the data as a char[].
     * <p>
     * The EOL sequence may be any of the standard formats: '\n' (unix), '\r' (mac), "\r\n" (dos).
     * The EOL sequence is always completely read off the stream but is never included in the result.
     * <i>Note:</i> this means that the result will never contain the chars '\n' or '\r'.
     * In order to guarantee reading thru but not beyond the EOL sequence for all formats (unix, mac, dos),
     * this method requires that a PushbackInputStream and not a more general InputStream be supplied.
     * <p>
     * The code is secure: no Strings are used, only char arrays,
     * and all such arrays other than the result are guaranteed to be blanked out after last use to ensure privacy.
     * Thus, this method is suitable for reading in sensitive information such as passwords.
     * <p>
     * This method never returns null; if no data before the EOL or EOF is read, a zero-length char[] is returned.
