<h1>JStyx tutorial</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial gives an overview of the JStyx library and how it is 
used to create server and client applications. It assumes that you 
are familiar with Java programming, although you will by no means 
need to be an expert.</p>
<p>In the world of Styx, everything is represented as a file. In order 
to create a Styx server, we create a hierarchy of files (a 
<em>namespace</em>) and serve it up. Conversely, Styx clients open 
files 
on the remote server and interact with them using read and write 
operations. Files have their own permissions, just like on a Unix-like 
system.</p>

<h2>Setting up</h2>
<p><em>How will the files be released? Easiest way would be a simple zip 
file with all libs, startup scripts, source etc.</em><p>

<h2>Testing the installation</h2>
<p><em>run TestServer, log on with StyxBrowser</em></p>

<h2>Creating a server</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, creating a Styx server is a matter of creating a 
hierarchy of files, then serving it up and waiting for connections. In 
order to create a file for serving, we simply subclass the abstract 
class <tt>uk.ac.rdg.resc.jstyx.server.StyxFile</tt>.
