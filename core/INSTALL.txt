Installing JStyx
================================

The process of installing the JStyx software (which includes the
Styx Grid Services software) is very simple on all platforms.  In summary:
   * Install a Java runtime environment and add the java program to your PATH.
   * Unpack the JStyx distribution.
   * Set the JSTYX_HOME environment variable and add JSTYX_HOME/bin to
     your PATH.

1. Set up Java
==============

JStyx is a set of Java classes and so we need a Java runtime environment
to run the software:
   * Download and install a Java runtime environment version 1.4.2 or above from
     http://java.sun.com
   * Add the bin directory of the Java installation to your PATH environment
     variable
   * Test this by opening a new terminal window or command prompt and typing
     "java -version". The version number of the Java installation should be
     printed to the console.  This should work from any directory on your system.


2. Install JStyx
================

The JStyx software is essentially the same on all platforms because it consists
of a set of platform-independent Java libraries.  The only difference between
the different distributions is the scripts that are used to launch JStyx
programs (these scripts are .bat files under Windows and shell scripts under Unix
and are found in the bin directory of the distribution).
      
Windows installation instructions:
   * Unzip the software into the directory of your choice (e.g. C:\JStyx).
   * Set the environment variable JSTYX_HOME to the location of the JStyx software
     (e.g. C:\JStyx).
   * Append the directory %JSTYX_HOME%\bin to the PATH environment variable.

   Note: to set an environment variable in Windows, right-click on "My Computer";
   and click the "Advanced" tab.  Click on "Environment Variables".  A Google
   search will reveal more information if you need it.
      
Unix/Linux installation instructions:
   (Note: these instructions might also work on Mac OSX, but this hasn't been tested yet.)
   * Unpack the software into the directory of your choice
     (e.g. cd /home/jon/JStyx; tar xzf jstyx-0.2.0-unix.tar.gz</code>).
   * Set the environment variable JSTYX_HOME to the location of the JStyx software
     (e.g. export JSTYX_HOME=/home/jon/JStyx).
   * Append the directory $JSTYX_HOME\bin to the PATH environment variable 
     (e.g. export PATH=$PATH:$JSTYX_HOME/bin).

   If you use the C shell you can set an environment variable like this:
   setenv JSTYX_HOME /home/jon/JStyx.
   
   Add the JSTYX_HOME and PATH environment variables to your startup scripts so
   that you do not have to set them every time you want to run the JStyx software.


3. Test the installation
========================

To verify that your installation is working, open a new terminal window
(or command prompt) and enter "SGSRun" with no arguments.  If all is well, you
should just see a usage message:

    Usage: SGSRun <hostname> <port> <servicename> [args]

If you get an error message saying that the SGSRun program cannot
be found, you have not set your PATH correctly.  If you get an error message 
saying "NoClassDefFoundError" you have not set your JSTYX_HOME
environment variable correctly.


Access to source code repository
================================

(This is only relevant for people who want to access the latest version of
the original source code.  Note that the latest version of the source code
might well contain bugs or might not work at all!)

The JStyx code is hosted on Sourceforge's Subversion server at
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jstyx/trunk/core.  Anybody can download
the entire code base, but only developers can check changes back in.  See the
README.txt file in the distribution for build instructions.
