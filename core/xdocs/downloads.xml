    <section name="Downloading the JStyx libraries">
      <p>Currently the only way to download the JStyx libraries is as a platform-independent installer
      package in JAR format. The latest version is 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT and you can download it from 
      <a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/jstyx/jstyx-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-installer.jar?download">here</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Installing the software">
      <p>If you have downloaded the JAR installer (currently the only option) you can start the installer
      by running:
      <source>
      java -jar jstyx-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-installer.jar
      </source>
      This has been tested on Windows and Unix.  You will need a Java runtime environment version 1.4.2 or
      above (<a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com</a>) in order to run the installer (and,
      indeed, to run the software).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Under Unix, you might find that the scripts do not
      work: you might get messages like "bad interpreter: no such file or directory"
      or "Command not found". In this case, the newlines in the script might have been
      inadvertently converted to Windows/DOS newlines. You can fix this by running
      "<code>perl -pi -e 's/\r//' *</code>" in the <code>bin/</code> directory
      of the installation.</p>
    </section>
    <section name="Uninstalling the software">
      <p>If you installed using the JAR installer, you can uninstall the software
      by changing to the "Uninstall" directory of the distribution and running
      <source>
      java -jar uninstaller.jar
      </source>
      If you are running Windows, there is probably a shortcut to this uninstaller
      in the JStyx program group in the Start Menu.</p>
