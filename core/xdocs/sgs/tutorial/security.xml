    <p>
    In the current public release (0.2.0), security is not implemented properly.
    There is no authentication of users nor encryption of network traffic.  This
    is a high priority for addressing in future releases.  Please email the jstyx-users
    <a href="../../mail-lists.html">mailing list</a> if you would like this 
    to be enabled urgently: this will encourage the developers and we might be
    able to send you an early version of a future release or direct you to
    the source code repository.
    </p>
    <p>
    A security mechanism based upon secure authentication of users, Unix-style
    fine-grained access control to individual Styx files and SSL-based encryption of
    network traffic is under development.
