Contains third-party libraries on which JStyx depends.  Newer versions of these
libraries should also work, but have (probably) not been tested.  For the JStyx
library itself, please see the dist directory of this distribution.  (If the
JStyx library isn't present, change into the bin directory of the distribution
and enter "build".)
