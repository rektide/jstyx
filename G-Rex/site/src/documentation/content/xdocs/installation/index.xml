      <title>Basic instructions</title>
      <p>
        G-Rex is (as far as we know) a standard Java web application that should
        work with a number of containers that support version 2.4 of the 
        Java Servlet Specification and version 2.0 of the Java Server Pages
        Specification.  We have only tested with <a href="ext:tomcat">Tomcat</a>
        version 5.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install G-Rex, simply copy the <code>.war</code> file into the <code>webapps</code>
        directory of your container.  Depending on your container, the G-Rex
        application might be extracted and deployed automatically, or you might
        have to restart the server: see your container documentation for more details.

      <title>Things to watch out for</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Make sure the <code>.grex</code> directory is not on a network file system.</strong>
          By default, G-Rex will create a directory called <code>.grex</code> to hold information about the
          state of the server, working directories for service instances, log
          files and so forth.  This is created in the user's home directory by
          default.  If the <code>.grex</code> directory is on a network file system (e.g. NFS)
          then the embedded Berkeley database may not function as expected.  The fix for 
          this is to create a symbolic link in <code>$HOME</code> that points to
          a suitable directory on the local hard disk.
